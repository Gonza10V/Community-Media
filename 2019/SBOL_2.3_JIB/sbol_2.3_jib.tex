\begin{abstract}

People who are engineering biological organisms often find it useful to communicate in
diagrams, both about the structure of the nucleic acid sequences that they are engineering 
and about the functional relationships between sequence features and other molecular species.
%
Some typical practices and conventions have begun to emerge for such
diagrams.  The Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOL Visual) has been developed as a standard 
for organizing and systematizing such
conventions in order to produce a coherent language for expressing
the structure and function 
of genetic designs. 
%
This document details version 2.1 of SBOL Visual, which builds on the prior SBOL Visual 2.0 standard by
expanding diagram syntax to include 
methods for showing modular structure and mappings between elements of a system,
interactions arrows that can split or join (with the glyph at the split or join indicating either superposition or a chemical process), 
and adding new glyphs for indicating genomic context (e.g., integration into a plasmid or genome) and for stop codons.
