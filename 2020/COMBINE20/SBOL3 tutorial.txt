Title: SBOL Version 3: Simplified Data Exchange for Bioengineering

Tutor: Jacob Beal, Tom Mitchell, Goksel Misirli

Abstract:
The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) allows knowledge about biological designs to be captured using a machine-tractable, ontology-backed representation that is built using Semantic Web technologies. While early versions of SBOL focused only on the description of DNA-based components and their sub-components, SBOL can now be used to represent knowledge across multiple scales and throughout the entire synthetic biology workflow, from the specification of a single molecule or DNA fragment through to multicellular systems containing multiple interacting genetic circuits. 

The third major iteration of the SBOL standard, SBOL3, is an effort to streamline and simplify the underlying data model with a focus on real-world applications, based on experience from the deployment of SBOL in a variety of scientific and industrial settings. This tutorial will provide the following to attendees:
- general introduction to SBOL
- explanation of the new SBOL3 data model in detail
- comparison SBOL3 and SBOL2, 
- hands-on experience with libraries implementing SBOL3.
