\begin{abstract}

People who are engineering biological organisms often find it useful to communicate in
diagrams, both about the structure of the nucleic acid sequences that they are engineering 
and about the functional relationships between sequence features and other molecular species.
%
Some typical practices and conventions have begun to emerge for such
diagrams.  The Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOL Visual) has been developed as a standard 
for organizing and systematizing such
conventions in order to produce a coherent language for expressing
the structure and function 
of genetic designs. 
%
This document details version 2.0 of SBOL Visual, which builds on the prior SBOL Visual 1.0 standard by
expanding diagram syntax to include functional interactions and molecular species, 
making the relationship between diagrams and the SBOL data model explicit, 
supporting families of symbol variants, 
clarifying a number of requirements and best practices,
and significantly expanding the collection of diagram glyphs.
